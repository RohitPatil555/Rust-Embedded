# Firmware Rust

In this we will look at basic technique that can get use by rust while developing firmware.

* Example 1 - This is about basic entry points in firmware written in rust with rust ecosystem.
* Example 2 - This is focus on calling C APIs from rust language.
* Example 3 - This is focus on calling Rust APIs from C language.
* Example 4 - This focus on handling custom memory management for embedded.
* Example 5 - This focus on understanding about future.
* Example 6 - In this, we will see management of structure instances in embedded as static allocation.
* Example 7 - This focus on getting basic understanding about macro_rules.
* Example 8 - Basic example of procedure macro.
* Example 9 - Develop DSL using procedure macro.
* Example 10 - Build derive macro to pack information in json format.
* Example 11 - This have dependency to above example 4,5 and 1. In this example we will be writing basic co-operative scheduling mini-os using async-await rust feature.
